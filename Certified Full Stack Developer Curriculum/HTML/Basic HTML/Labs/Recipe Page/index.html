      <h1>Chicken Fricass√©e (quick French chicken stew)</h1>

      <p>
        Chicken Fricass√©e is a traditional French chicken stew made with browned
        chicken pieces braised in a creamy white mushroom sauce. A rustic
        family-style meal that‚Äôs easy enough for midweek, it‚Äôs a bit like a
        white sauce version of
        <a href="https://www.recipetineats.com/coq-au-vin/">Coq au Vin</a> ‚Äì
        except it‚Äôs so much faster to make!

        <p>
          Pronounced ‚Äúfri-ka-say‚Äù, this is a terrific recipe to get a cosy stew
          fix any night of the week without hours of slow cooking. This dish is
          a traditional French chicken stew made with a creamy white sauce with
          mushrooms, instead of the more common rich, dark brown sauce like you
          ordinarily see with stews, such as with
          <a href="https://www.recipetineats.com/coq-au-vin/">Coq au Vin</a> and
          this baked
          <a href="https://www.recipetineats.com/chicken-stew/">Chicken Stew</a
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          I‚Äôm just going to tell it to you straight: the chicken is lovely
          (juicy, golden brown, etc etc) ‚Ä¶ but this dish is all about the creamy
          white sauce!!!

            <h3>CHICKEN PIECES</h3>
            <p>
              This dish is best made with skin-on, bone-in chicken pieces that
              stay nice and juicy after simmering in the sauce. Mind you, this
              is a quick stew that only calls for 30 minutes of simmering time.
              But still, boneless breast or thigh would overcook in this time.
              Having said that, I‚Äôve included in notes in the recipe for how I
              would make Chicken Fricass√©e with breast and boneless thighs,
              because I know some of you will ask!!

              Here are the other ingredients required for Chicken Fricass√©e:

              alt="other ingredients"
            />

            <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
              <li>
                <strong>Garlic and onion</strong> ‚Äì The foundation upon which
                many savoury dishes are built, and Chicken Fricass√©e is no
                exception!
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Leaves and thyme</strong> ‚Äì The herb flavourings for the
                sauce. Fresh is best if you have them, else dried is fine.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Butter</strong> ‚Äì It‚Äôs a French dish. Say no more! üòÇ
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Mushrooms</strong> ‚Äì The traditional vegetable included
                in the sauce. Though really, this is such an adaptable dish that
                it can be made with any vegetable suitable for braising. Add
                those that can withstand a 30 minute braising time at the
                beginning, and faster-cooking vegetables (like green beans and
                asparagus) towards the end.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>White wine</strong> ‚Äì Any white wine that‚Äôs not too
                woody or sweet will work great here. Chardonnay in particular
                adds really good flavour. Substitute with more low-sodium
                chicken stock/broth for a non-alcoholic version.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Chicken stock/broth</strong> ‚Äì This dish is extremely
                tasty made with regular store-bought chicken stock. But it
                becomes a restaurant-quality treat if you make it with
                <a href="https://www.recipetineats.com/chicken-stock-recipe/"
                  >homemade chicken stock</a
                >
                ! Homemade chicken stock is straightforward to make and really
                worth it for the added deliciousness. (Bonus: It‚Äôs lower sodium
                than store bought and you get extra nutrients from the bones).
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Flour</strong> ‚Äì Used to lightly thicken the sauce
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Cream</strong> ‚Äì This also thickens the sauce as well as
                making the sauce rich, creamy and decadent!

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
          <img
            src="https://www.recipetineats.com/tachyon/2021/09/How-to-make-Chicken-Fricasse-1.jpg?resize=900%2C502&zoom=0.72"
            alt="first four steps"
          />
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Brown chicken</strong> ‚Äì First, we sprinkle the chicken
              with salt and pepper. Then in a large skillet or pot that has a
              lid, melt the butter over medium-high heat. (If your pot/skillet
              doesn‚Äôt have a lid or you don‚Äôt have a lid from another pot that
              is the same size or larger, don‚Äôt stress, there‚Äôs options ‚Äì I
              outline these in the simmering step.)
            </p>

            <p>
              Brown the chicken thighs first, placing them in the butter skin
              side down. Cook them for 4 ‚Äì 5 minutes until nice and golden, then
              turn and cook the other side for just 1 minute. Remove the thighs
              from the skillet to a plate or tray. Now do the drumsticks. For
              drumsticks, I usually sear 3 sides which gets decent coverage all
              around ‚Äì about 2 minutes on each side. Once done, add them to the
              plate holding the thighs.
            </p>

            <p>
              There will still be plenty of butter left in the skillet, which
              has now transformed into browned butter. Which means it‚Äôs extra
              tasty ‚Äì woo!
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Saut√© mushrooms</strong> ‚Äì To start the sauce, saut√© the
              onions, mushrooms, thyme and bay leaves for around 5 minutes in
              the residual butter, adding the garlic towards the end. The
              mushrooms will change from white to light golden, but won‚Äôt go a
              deep golden brown. There‚Äôs no point browning mushrooms well
              because they will lose the colour when braised.
            </p>

            <p>
              Then add the flour and cook it for 1 minute to cook out the raw
              floury taste.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Add stock and wine</strong> ‚Äì Then add the wine and
              chicken stock. Stir well, scraping the base of the pot to dissolve
              all the golden bits stuck on the base of the pot into the sauce.
              This stuff is called ‚Äúfond‚Äù and it‚Äôs concentrated flavours that
              makes the sauce even tastier!
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Return chicken to pan</strong> ‚Äì Return the chicken to the
            pot, skin side up. It will mostly be submerged, and that‚Äôs exactly
            what we want. The braising liquid will keep the chicken nice and
            juicy, while the chicken will absorb the tasty sauce flavour!
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Simmer covered 10 minutes</strong> ‚Äì Once the chicken is
              in the sauce, bring the liquid back up to a simmer. Then adjust
              the heat so it‚Äôs bubbling constantly but not boiling rapidly ‚Äì see
              video to see what this looks like. On my stove, it‚Äôs medium heat.
            </p>

            <p>Cover with a lid and cook for 10 minutes.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Uncovered 20 minutes</strong> ‚Äì Remove the lid then simmer
              for a further 20 minutes. In this step, the sauce will reduce and
              thicken into a thin gravy consistency.
            </p>

            <p>
              <em>‚ÄúWhen is the chicken cooked?‚Äù</em> ‚Äì By this time, the chicken
              will be cooked. 30 minutes mightn‚Äôt sound like long for a stew,
              but that‚Äôs all you need because the chicken is cooked submerged in
              a very hot liquid. It will be completely cooked and quite tender,
              though not at the ‚Äúfall-apart-at-a-touch‚Äù stage which is
              intentional.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Now make the sauce creamy</strong> ‚Ä¶ ‚Äì Remove chicken from
              the sauce to a plate. Add the cream, stir, then bring the sauce
              back up to a simmer.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Garnish and serve!</strong> Once the sauce comes back up to
            a simmer, return the chicken to the sauce. There‚Äôs no need to simmer
            the sauce after the cream is added.

            <p>
              Garnish with a good amount of parsley, and it‚Äôs ready to serve!
            </p>
