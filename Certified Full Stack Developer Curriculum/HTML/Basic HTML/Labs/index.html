    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1kg Maris Piper potatoes</li>
      <li>olive oil</li>
      <li>½ a bunch of fresh rosemary (10g)</li>
      <li>1 bulb of garlic</li>
      <li>1 x 1.6kg whole free-range chicken</li>
      <li>1 lemon</li>
      <li>
        ½ a bunch of mixed woody herbs, such as rosemary, sage, thyme, bay
        leaves
      </li>
      <li>a few sprigs of fresh thyme</li>
      <li>1 heaped tablespoon plain flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas 6.</li>
      <li>
        Peel the potatoes, halving any larger ones. Parboil in a large pan of
        boiling salted water for 12 minutes, then drain in a colander and leave
        to steam-dry for 2 minutes. Give the colander a few light shakes to
        chuff up the edges of the potatoes, giving you maximum surface area for
        a crispy exterior as they roast.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tip the potatoes into a roasting tray with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and
        a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Strip in half of the rosemary
        leaves, squash and add the unpeeled garlic cloves, then toss together
        well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rub the chicken all over with a pinch of salt and pepper and 1
        tablespoon of oil in a large sturdy roasting tray. Stuff the chicken
        cavity with the whole lemon, mixed woody herbs and remaining rosemary
        sprigs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roast the chicken and potatoes for 1 hour 20 minutes, or until golden
        and cooked through, basting the chicken and giving the potato tray a
        shake every now and then.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the time’s up, transfer the chicken to a platter to rest (you can
        keep the potatoes in the oven a little longer if you like them extra
        crispy).
      </li>
      <li>
        Boil the kettle. Angle the chicken tray and use a spoon to skim away
        about three-quarters of the excess fat (keep this in a jar for tasty
        cooking another day). Place the tray on a medium heat on the hob and
        stir in the flour with a wooden spoon, scraping up all the sticky bits
        from the base and sides of the tray, then pour in 600ml of boiling
        kettle water and any resting juices from the chicken platter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir well and simmer until you’ve reached your desired consistency, then
        pour the gravy through a coarse sieve into a saucepan, pushing all that
        goodness through with the back of a ladle. Keep warm until you’re ready
        to eat, then transfer to Jamie’s .
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve everything in the middle of the table on a or divide between ,
        with steamed seasonal greens, such as Swiss chard, spring greens,
        asparagus or kale, and all your usual trimmings and sauces (we've gone
        for English mustard in one of Jamie's ).
